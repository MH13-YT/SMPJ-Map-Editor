This software is designed for Python 3.12 and pip modules
Please note that it is still in an experimental stage and requires advanced knowledge of Switch modding, including the use of Switch Toolbox, as well as modding for the game Super Mario Party Jamboree.

I kindly ask that you refrain from publicly sharing standalone versions of this project (e.g., through PyInstaller). However, for your personal convenience, you are welcome to compile it using PyInstaller.
Making the software more accessible in this way would force me to manage both the R&D of the project and user support at the same time, which would complicate the development process.

The project will remain in its experimental phase and listed under the WIP category on GameBanana until Python offers modules capable of decompressing and recompressing the game's BEA archives or until I find a reliable method to handle these archives.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Kind regards,
